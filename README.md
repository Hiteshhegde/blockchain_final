# Simple implementation of block chain
 A simple blockchain implementation using python
# How to run the code

  To start a blockchain node, go to blockchain folder and execute the command below:
  
  python blockchain.py -p 5001
  
  You can add a new node to blockchain by executing the same command and specifying a port that is not already used. For         example, 
  
  python blockchain.py -p 5001

  To start the blockchain client, go to blockchain_client folder and execute the command below: python blockchain_client.py   
  
  -p 8081 or any unused high level port

  You can access the blockchain frontend and blockchain client dashboards from your browser by going to localhost:5001 and       localhost:8081
